**Connect 4**

Description: 
A classic connect 4 game created with pygame. The goal of this development project was to gain some experience with pygame, 
as this is my first project using the module. I used the code from Connect4CommandLine for most of the backend.

Instructions:
To place a piece, click on the middle of the selected column. Take turns until a winner is crowned. Press the "r" key on the keyboard to restart the game at any time.
